# (For now) a very loose collections of ideas

- Add local only mode
  - Implication would be the need to do everything on device and not the server
- Add support for iCloud (possibly as a purchase)
- Data export feature
- A long press on an error notification to copy it to the clipboard (maybe even add more info to failures)
- Add identifying colors on timeline and map. Either for for different categories of places or a type of gradient that signifies passage of time 
- Adjust phrasing of the app's welcome dialog (is the app still "fully" open source due to the dual license? + it probably won't be completely - but still mostly - free)
- Think about monetization: 
  - I definitely want the app to be free when self hosted
  - Charging for iCloud access could be a way
  - It should be affordable (like 5 euros per year or 20 euros for lifetime)
