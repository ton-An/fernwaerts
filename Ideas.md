# (For now) a very loose collections of ideas

- Add local only mode
  - Implication would be the need to do everything on device and not the server
- Add support for iCloud (possibly as a purchase)
- Data export feature
- A long press on an error notification to copy it to the clipboard (maybe even add more info to failures)
- Add identifying colors on timeline and map. Either for for different categories of places or a type of gradient that signifies passage of time
